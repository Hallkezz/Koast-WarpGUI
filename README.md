# Koast-WarpGUI
**Hey!**

I sometimes did not like the original WarpGUI. So I decided to modify this module.
The main difference from the original WarpGUI is customization. You can customize the module as you like. (You need to change the settings in the script itself).
Also, the new module has more functionality. For example Do Not Disturb.

Original module: www.jc-mp.com/forums/index.php/topic,3841.0.html

**How to use:**
* Type ***/tpm*** to open the menu.
* Press ***"V"*** to open/close the menu.
